# Introduction To R

Welcome! The vast amount of data produced by evolving information technology requires tools and skills. Among the many tools, R is a free, open-source language and an environment that could be used for data sciences. This course aims to cover topics in R and data science, with applications illustrated via RStudio. This course is part of the University of Toronto's Data Sciences Institute professional programming.

# Course Overview

## Description
This course is designed for learners who have a degree in something other than Computer Science/Statistics who are looking to enhance their data science skills for their career. The first part of this course teaches R with a focus on manipulating and visualizing data. Learners will get set up with a functional RStudio workflow, use different file types, transform data tables, import and manipulate data, use functions and loops, create data visualizations, make a Shiny app, and learn how to solve problems with their programming. Both base R and tidyverse methods are taught. To work reproducibly, learners will create R Projects. 

## Learning Outcomes
1.	Setting up and using R and RStudio.
2.	Manipulating and visualizing data.
3.	Fixing errors.
4.	Understanding consent in data-based studies.
5.	Making presentations and managing projects.

# Logistical Information

## Course Contacts
-   Instructor for this course is [**Anjali Silva**](https://anjalisilva.github.io/), PhD (she/her).
For emails to the instructor, use a.silva@utoronto.ca. Must use the subject line DSI-IntroR. E.g., DSI-IntroR: Inquiry about Lecture I.

-   Teaching Assistant for this is **Tia Harrison**, MSc, PhD Candidate (she/her). 
For emails to the teaching assistant, use tia.harrison@mail.utoronto.ca.

## Delivery Instructions
The course will be held over a period of 2 weeks, with classes taking place 3 days a week. Format will be online - synchronous via Zoom. Learners must have internet connection and a computer with a microphone and required sofware implemented in order to participate. Keep microphones muted, unless you need to speak. Please indicate your name before speaking. Keeping your video on is optional, however, if you choose to leave it on, be mindful of what your peers can see. Course communications will take place via email. All course material will be available via [IntroductionToR](https://github.com/anjalisilva/IntroductionToR) GitHub repository. Folder structure is as follows:
   * Lessons - All files: This folder contains all files.
   * **Lessons - Data only**: This folder contains data only.
   * **Lessons - Lesson Plans only**: This folder contains lesson plans only.
   * **Lessons - PDF only**: This folder contains slide PDFs only.
   * README - README file
   * .gitignore - Files to ignore specified by instructor

## Materials
* **Learners must have internet connection and a computer with a microphone in order to participate in online activities.** 
* **Learners must have R (http://www.r-project.org/).**
* **Learners must have RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/).**
* Screen space can be a limitation during online learning since you'll want to see the instructor's screen and have your RStudio open so that you can type along. If you have access to a second monitor or a larger tablet to attend the course while keeping your laptop screen available for coding - this would be great! If not - don't worry, we'll manage!

# Course Policies

## Course Expectations
-   The course will include mainly live-coding classes. Learners are expected to follow along with the coding. Be mindful of online fatigue. Be respectful and only one speaker at a time. Keep yourself on mute, unless you need to speak or ask a question. If you have a question, use raise hand feature. First say your name, then ask the question. You may type your questions to chat as well. Learners with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course.
