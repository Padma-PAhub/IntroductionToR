# Introduction To R

Welcome! The vast amount of data produced by evolving information technology requires tools and skills. Among the many tools, R is a free, open-source language and an environment that could be used for data sciences. This course aims to cover topics in R and data science, with applications illustrated via RStudio. This course is part of the University of Toronto's Data Sciences Institute professional programming.

# Course Overview

## Description
This course is designed for students who have a degree in something other than Computer Science/Statistics who are looking to enhance their data science skills for their career. The first part of this course teaches R with a focus on manipulating and visualizing data. Students will get set up with a functional RStudio workflow, use different file types, transform data tables, import and manipulate data, use functions and loops, create data visualizations, make a Shiny app, and learn how to solve problems with their programming. Both base R and tidyverse methods are taught. To work reproducibly, students will create R Projects. 

## Learning Outcomes
1.	Setting up and using R and RStudio.
2.	Manipulating and visualizing data.
3.	Fixing errors.
4.	Understanding consent in data-based studies.
5.	Making presentations and managing projects.

# Course Policies

## Course Expectations
The course will include mainly live-coding classes. Students are expected to follow along with the coding. Be mindful of online fatigue. 

## Accessibility
Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. In particular, if you have a disability/health consideration that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach me and/or Accessibility Services at 416-978 8060; studentlife.utoronto.ca/as.

## Mental Health and Well-being 
There are many helpful resources available through Student Life (http://studentlife.utoronto.ca). An important part of the education is learning how and when to ask for help. Take the time to inform yourself of available resources.


## Folder Structure
Below are the folders contained in this repo with a description of what they contain and information on how to use them.

### 1. *slides-resources*:
This folder contains all editable slides. To edit, download the entire folder, including the *pics* folder as this folder contains the pictures which are relationally referenced in the markdown files.

To change a photo, edit the markdown where photos are referenced.

Example: 

Change `![w:1150 center](pics/github.png)` to `![bg](pics/github.png)`

To add a photo, add photo to the *pics* folder and reference it within the markdown file.

Example:

Added photo labelled "git_commit.png" will be referenced in markdown file as `![w:1000 left](pics/git_commit.png)`

### 2. *teaching-notes*:
This folder contains the teaching notes for the Unix and Git/GitHub workshops. Teaching notes include additional information on each slide to reference, as well as optional material. These notes are designed to guide the instructor and give more detailed information to supplement the slides.

### 3. *pdf-slides*:
This folder contains the PDF versions of the slides for students to follow. Slides should be referenced before class to prepare or after class to review. During class will be live-coding, therefore, there is no need to follow them during class. They contain all information that was discussed in class and are a great resource in the future if students need to reassess their knowledge.

### 4. *homework*:
This folder contains homeowork for students to practice. It is separated by week, then by day. Please complete the Unix Shell homework in the first week, and the Git/GitHub homework in the second.

It is just a suggestion but it will help students throughout the workshop, as content is cumulative and will only get more difficult. Unfortunately, there is not enough time to review previous content each class so while this homework is **not** graded, it is highly recommended.
